---------------------------------------

My Literacy Sponsorship Map was incredibly difficult for me to complete, mainly because I had to think back and reflect on previous events which is something I rarely do. I had to also pick events that lined up appropriately with each type of literacy. Picking the events was difficult for me to do because it seemed pretty black and white about what was and wasn’t a Learning Outcome and I had to overcome that thinking, now I feel that each of my events accurately represent each Learning Outcome. 

Another struggle for me was writing each event, there was so much I wanted to put in but a lot of it was extraneous and would make the events way too long. Ultimately I determined that the proper length was about 2 paragraphs that explained each event. Another issue was finding pictures that would do a good job explaining each event, mainly because I don’t document my life events very well! Overall it was a very challenging assignment, but I was glad for the opportunity to look back and reminisce about the past.

###After Reflection
My Literacy Map was the first assignment I did in UWRT 1103 and it was one of the hardest assignments I did in this class because it made me reflect on different events and write about them. I had to develop a **Composing Process** to put everything on the map and ensure that my ideas flowed and I was able to effectively revise them as I put the map together. As part of my **Composing Process** I had to use **Rhetorical Knowledge** to effectively write in the medium of the assignment, knowing that I need to modify my writing style to fit the style of the Google Map.  My **Knowledge of Conventions** also played a big role in this assignment, it gave me an idea of how I had to do the write ups for each part of the map so that my audience can understand what I am trying to say.
