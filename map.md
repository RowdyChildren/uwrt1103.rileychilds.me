---------------------------------------

My Literacy Sponsorship Map was incredibly difficult for me to complete, mainly because I had to think back and reflect on previous events which is something I rarely do. I had to also pick events that lined up appropriately with each type of literacy. Picking the events was difficult for me to do because it seemed pretty black and white about what was and wasn’t a Learning Outcome and I had to overcome that thinking, now I feel that each of my events accurately represent each Learning Outcome. 

Another struggle for me was writing each event, there was so much I wanted to put in but a lot of it was extraneous and would make the events way too long. Ultimately I determined that the proper length was about 2 paragraphs that explained each event. Another issue was finding pictures that would do a good job explaining each event, mainly because I don’t document my life events very well! Overall it was a very challenging assignment, but I was glad for the opportunity to look back and reminisce about the past.
