###Reflection

This discussion is about confirmation bias, the original author and previous commenters express concern about the lack of information available. This lack of information, although not intentional, is believed by the commenters to have the potential to cause an innate confirmation bias because the author’s mind “automatically fill in the gaps” when there is missing information. I mention how the author is in a true catch-22 where there is not enough information to provide a through, bias free understanding but there IS enough to write a paper and they should note that fact when writing and explain why more information is needed. Other people in the thread suggest broadening the topic to see if the author can find more detailed sources.
