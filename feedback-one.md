##Review Excerpt

 Your use of sources gave me a sense that you have done research and have a greater knowledge of the topic than most. I noticed that I often could go more than 4 lines without seeing a name used for citation. Your paraphrases or quotes flowed very well together. They almost always work hand-in-hand with the previous quote used which really makes the paper flow well. The only thing I noticed is that you never really point out specific examples of sports teams and cities. I suggest that you put some more examples of sports teams and cities so readers can get a greater grasp on how close they are to the issue you are addressing.
 
 
##Example of Use

[...]The latter occurred when the **Phoenix Coyotes** went bankrupt and Glendale, the city where they **Coyotes** are located, began paying an “arena management fee” to the pair of Canadian Investors that purchased the team netting the investors well over the initial $120 million they paid (Neil deMause). These are the sorts of arrangements that are hurting cities and taxpayers.[...]

##How did I use it?

This a specific instance in the paper where I utilized the feedback that I need to give specific examples. I had initially not used any real world examples and it left my defense somewhat weak, adding example strengthened my defense.
