##Example 1

The very first peer review we did in class was when we all circled up and talked about our various topics. During this peer review session I gave several people feedback about their topics and I believe that the feedback I gave was helpful. The feedback I gave to several different people was about how they could broben their topics to get a “higher level view”. The feedback was well received by many of my peers and overall I think it was a success.

##Example 2

The second peer review I did was one on one, I helped someone out by giving them meaningful feedback about their assignment. When I gave the feedback I was sure I focused on the higher level of content rather than the nitty gritty grammar. The larger view they were given was important to the person who I was peer reviewing for because they got feedback on how they can improve the paper as a piece rather than just bits and pieces, it helped them make their assignment flow. Overall between my first and second peer review I feel that I have improved the quality of the feedback I gave.
