###Reflection

Overall I do not think this has been my best work this semester, but I think it accomplished what was requested. My biggest struggle with this assignment was getting the data I needed to produce my genre product. This has been one of the most chalengeing projects for me this semester, between locating scholarly resources from a very limited pool to having to work hard to get access to the data I needed. Even though this project was chalengeing I throughly enjoyed it and wished I had more time to get the larger dataset I wanted so that I could more accurately do the project. In the future I am going to make sure that I am not idle when waiting on resources and will check in constantly, In addition I plan to make sure that my plan (and backups) is a little more concrete so I am better prepared.

##After Reflection

For the revision of a written piece I did my Genre Project, the 2 areas I focused on were elimination of vaguity and putting more of the paper in the third person and out of the first person. I chose these two aspects of my writing to revise because I felt that based on my **Knowledge of Conventions** these sorts of essays are not typically written in the fashion I wrote it in. I modified my **Composing Process** when I rewrote my paper to make sure that I was writing it in the proper fashion and made the changes I said I would. Overall this was a very challenging assignment that required me to use my **Critical Reading** skills to gain an understanding of how I needed to apply and interpret the information I located during my research. Although this was a difficult project, overall it was very fulfilling.
