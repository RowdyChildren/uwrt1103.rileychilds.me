##Reflection
Overall I do not think this has been my best work this semester, but I think it accomplished what was requested. My biggest struggle with this assignment was getting the data I needed to produce my genre product. This has been one of the most chalengeing projects for me this semester, between locating scholarly resources from a very limited pool to having to work hard to get access to the data I needed. Even though this project was chalengeing I throughly enjoyed it and wished I had more time to get the larger dataset I wanted so that I could more accurately do the project. In the future I am going to make sure that I am not idle when waiting on resources and will check in constantly, In addition I plan to make sure that my plan (and backups) is a little more concrete so I am better prepared.
