##Reflection

This was one of the first assignments I completed in the class, and I think it is representative of where I was when I started this class. It provides a good juxtaposition to my Outside Wildcard because it is the very first assignment I did in the class. I personally think that this is not my best work when you compare it to my other assignments and that if you look at my work following this you will see a great uptick in quality.
