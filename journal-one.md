##Entries

Journal 1:
I often develop a curiosity because I am researching something and get sidetracked, this in turn leads me on to bigger topics and research. After I have researched my curiosity I tend to want to actually do something with it and that is how I cultivate it.

Journal 2:
Once I have cultivated a curiosity I sometimes let it fall away and other times I keep with it. Even though I might sometimes let a curiosity fall away I can find myself going back to it in many different ways. More often than not as one curiosity falls away and another takes it’s place it is because I have fallen deeper into the previous curiosity and the scope has changed so to speak.

Journal 3:
I think it is true because curious people learn more, they want to go in depth and understand a topic better. Curious people want to understand that topic can go onto the next and then the next and then the next and so one, as people learn they become smarter. Being curious is the best way to learn.

Journal 4:
I am keeping myself curious be keeping myself involved with Student Organizations that allow me to explore my interests, moreover I approach my academic career  at UNCC as a way to better my knowledge rather than an outcome of a “job”.

 
##Reflection

These journals were part of the Journal assignment called Curiosities. These 4 entries are about how people are curious, why I am curious, and how I become curious.  I answered the questions asked pretty directly based on the assignment sheet provided to me. Although I do think in this set of Journals I go deeper than the questions.
