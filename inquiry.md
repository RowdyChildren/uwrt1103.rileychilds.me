###My Reflection
Looking back upon my work there was a lot I could have improved. I feel that I should have focused more on my inquiry map instead of jumping straight into it, I should have put more work into pre-writing for this assignment. I should have focused more on coming up with arguments before I started my paper, instead I “sort of” used my map and just developed my paper as I wrote instead of having a very good idea of what to write. I also needed to start writing much earlier, towards the end I felt very rushed and I think it shows it in my work.

###After Reflection
For my Inquiry Project I had to work on my **Knowledge of Conventions** so I could properly cite my sources and understand when I had to do so that I could properly attribute my research. My Inquiry Project required a slight modification of my normal **Composing Process** because of the Inquiry Map portion of the project and as such this modified both my pre-writing process and my writing process. A critical part of this assignment was my **Critical Reading**, a big part of the assignment was being able to understand how different resources were related and how they can be tied together to form a cohesive ideas. If I had the opportunity to I think I would go back and exercise my **Critical Reading** skills even more to better develop my sources overall. I felt good with the completion of my Inquiry Project because from it I learned a lot and honed my writing skills.
