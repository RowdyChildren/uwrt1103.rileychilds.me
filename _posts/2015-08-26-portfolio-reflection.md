Putting together my portfolio was an interesting exercise, I learned a lot about how I have grown this semester and how I still have room to grow. Throughout the semester I struggled to write more than the minimum, something I still struggle with. I hope that as my college career progresses I am able to utilize the skills I have gained in this class to improve my writing and become a better writer. This portfolio has shown me my growth, growth that I didnâ€™t even know I had made and it has also shown me how far I have to grow. This portfolio is representative of who I am as a writer up until now, it shows I have a lot to do to get better and I plan to take those steps.
