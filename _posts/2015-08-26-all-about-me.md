Hello! My Name is Riley Childs and I am a Freshmen Undergraduate Student Majoring in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am currently taking UWRT1103 Sec 017 to improve my writing, grammer, and style. I am also taking it to satisfy a Gen Ed requirement for my Major. I hope after reading my Portfolio you begin to get an accurate reflection of who I am and what my beliefs are.<br />

Thanks for reading!<br />
