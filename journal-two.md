##Entry

Some specific presentations stood out more than others, mainly because the ideas were a little more well formed and articulate , such as Jesus’ presentation. No one, as far as I remember, talked about their Critical Reflection, I think this was because people don’t like to reflect on their “faults”. Personally I think my presentation went well, although I feel I mumbled over parts of my presentation I think I got my point across pretty effectively. I also felt mine was comparable to other’s presentations. Everyone seemed to have a good firm idea of what their literacy was and why they chose it.
