##Reflection

I wrote this piece for my Theatre Appreciation class, it is about when I saw A Christmas Carol at Theatre Charlotte. It is an analysis of the production, I chose this piece because I feel that it is representative of my growth this semester. It breaks up the various elements of the production and talks about them in depth. I have utilized several different skills I have learned in this class to write about the production. I worked on preplanning to get a full idea of what I need to write about and then I wrote it, making sure to follow my plan to the fullest. This paper was one of my best works this semester in my opinion and I think that my work in this class is reflected in it.
